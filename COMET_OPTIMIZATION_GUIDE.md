- **Atlas Advantages**: Deeper ChatGPT integration, agent mode for complex tasks

## Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. Prompt Structure Optimization
**Before (Generic):**
```
You are an agentic browser with keyboard/mouse control...
Task: Execute a BUY for AAPL...
```

**After (Comet-Optimized):**
```
Execute buy order for AAPL on Coinbase.

Trading parameters:
â€¢ Action: BUY
â€¢ Symbol: AAPL
â€¢ Order type: MARKET
...
```

### 2. Voice-Command Friendly Format
- **Bullet points** instead of numbered lists
- **Action-oriented language** (execute, navigate, calculate)
- **Conversational tone** suitable for voice input
- **Single-sentence commands** that can be spoken naturally

### 3. Platform-Specific Enhancements

#### Coinbase (Comet Partnership Integration)
```
ðŸš€ COMET-OPTIMIZED for Coinbase Partnership:
Access live BTC data through Perplexity integration. Execute buy order:
â†’ Use built-in Coinbase market data for BTC price analysis
â†’ Navigate to Coinbase trading interface
â†’ Leverage Comet's autonomous execution for seamless order placement
```

#### Other Platforms (Optimized Workflows)
- **Streamlined navigation** with arrow notation (â†’)
- **Calculation formulas** embedded in prompts
- **Context-aware instructions** that leverage Comet's page understanding

### 4. Execution Checklist Integration
```
COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
âœ“ Verify symbol matches: AAPL
âœ“ Confirm order type: MARKET
âœ“ Validate allocation: 2.0% of portfolio
âœ“ Check order status and provide execution summary
```

### 5. Voice Command Ready
Each prompt includes a ready-to-use voice command:
```
VOICE COMMAND: "Execute buy order for AAPL using 2.0% portfolio allocation on coinbase"
```

## Best Practices for Comet Trading
